## Node Modules
Before doing anything, you need to install necessary node_modules, which are javascript libraries. To do this, we use a package manager called npm. To use npm, download it [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), navigate into the SMK-frontend directory and run `npm install`. 

## Expo setup

Expo is a tool we use to generate builds for our apps. This repo already includes the files needed for an expo app, so building the application should be relatively simple.
* Download the Expo Development Client (can use mobile or desktop app), as well as the Expo Command Line Environment (Expo CLI). Instructions for both [here](https://expo.io/tools#cli)
* Making sure you have already run `expo init` or `npm install`, run `expo start` and your expo app should begin the build process.
* To view your app, open the Expo Development Client App and follow the instructions.

To create an expo app from scratch, see [this guide](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/create-a-new-app/).
